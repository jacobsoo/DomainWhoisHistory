DomainWhoisHistory
==================

Using domainAPI's Whois History API, we are not able to review data on domain name as it was at a specific date. 
All you need is to register a domainAPI account.
Using your own credentials and submit a domain name through the API and the API will retrieve the full historical whois record of the domain name at that time will be retrieved. 
This API service retrieves data from the leading Whois Service Provider “DomainTools”.
